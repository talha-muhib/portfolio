            <h2 class = "heading">INTERESTS</h2>
            <p>There are many topics that interest me, but two of them are<br>
                programming language (PL) designs and algorithm optimization.

                <br><br>
                <strong>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGNS:</strong><br>
                I've done several projects where I've implemented small langauges or added more features to a language.
                I wrote interpreters and compilers for features such as multiple return values, or function calls with rest parameters.<br><br>
                I also have some experience with the theoretical side of PL design, such as finite state machines, which are mathematical
                computations used to simulate sequential logic, and lambda calculus, a formal system for simulating function application.
                <br><br>

                <strong>ALGORITHM DESIGN & OPTIMIZATION:</strong><br>
                Although one of the hardest topics for me to understand, I am most fascinated by this area.
                I was first exposed to the P vs. NP problem in my "Intro to Algorithms" class, and the idea of
                an entire class of problems being solvable in polynomial time with non-deterministic algorithms was
                extremely intriguing. I also took an advanced algorithms class, where I learned about concepts such as
                dynamic programming, network flows, NP reductions and NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms.
