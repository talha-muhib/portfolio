            <p>Three topics which stand out to me are artificial intelligence,
                programming languages, and algorithm design.

                <br><br>
                <strong>ALGORITHM DESIGN & OPTIMIZATION:</strong><br>
                Algorithms have been both one of the most challenging and rewarding areas 
                of study for me. My first encounter with the P vs. NP problem during my 
                'Intro to Algorithms' class sparked my fascination with computational 
                complexity and the distinction between deterministic and non-deterministic 
                problem-solving. In an advanced algorithms course, I deepened my 
                understanding of concepts like dynamic programming, network flows, 
                NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. These studies have 
                sharpened my problem-solving skills and expanded my perspective 
                on how algorithms underpin modern computing.
                <br><br><br>

                <strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:</strong><br>
                My interest in artificial intelligence stems from its ability 
                to transform raw data into intelligent systems that can learn, 
                adapt, and solve complex problems. I have explored AI through 
                coursework and projects, covering topics like search algorithms, 
                optimization techniques, and reinforcement learning. One of my 
                favorite projects was designing a Pacman agent that used 
                reinforcement learning to improve its performance over time. 
                I've also worked on multi-agent systems and experimented with 
                heuristic methods to tackle challenging computational tasks. 
                AI's potential to bridge theory and application is what excites me 
                most, and I am eager to continue contributing to this evolving field.
                <br><br><br>
                
                <strong>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:</strong><br>
                I have hands-on experience designing and extending programming languages 
                through projects where I implemented small languages and added advanced 
                features like multiple return values and rest parameters in function calls. 
                My work has included writing interpreters and compilers, which gave me a 
                deeper appreciation for the mechanics of language processing. On the 
                theoretical side, I have explored finite state machines, which model 
                sequential logic, and lambda calculus, a framework for understanding 
                computation and function application. These experiences have fueled 
                my interest in how programming languages balance elegance and functionality.
