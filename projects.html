            <h3>I've done over 50 programming projects as an undergraduate CS student.
                Here are just a few of them that stand out to me. For some of these projects, 
                I cannot display the source code here due to academic integrity.
                However, I would be happy to share the code if requested. A good portion of these projects
                are public on my GitHub Page. (Link to GitHub is in the home page)</h3>
